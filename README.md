This project uses Java to implement a system for a therapy organization.

This program does everything from storing managers, members, operators, and providers with all necessary attributes like active status, name, and credentials. It also can store services and display members and providers the service they recieved/provided. EFT reports, manager reports, provider reports, and member reports are generated by a timer every friday at midnight. These reports give information about cost, time, duration, and information of services. It also tells the manager how much each provider needs to get paid. The program also has portals for every person to view their information and services. 

This was a group project spanning 3 weeks. Our group utilized the Agile project management system and also created steorotype and class diagrams before hand to plan the layout of the project.
