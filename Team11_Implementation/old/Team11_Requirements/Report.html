    <!-- &emsp is just 4 spaced -->
    <p>
      &emsp; Our group assumed that some use cases were done by different systems so therefore they did not fall into the ChocAn system itself. 
      First we produced a glossary and defined the actors and basic elements of the project. 
      Some terms were defined with more detail in order to make the descriptions simple and not repeat what was already defined. 
      Then we figured out the use cases by going line by line through the ChocAn project description. 
      We determined the actors first then how each actor interacted with the system and with other actors. 
      We made the assumption that the member itself does not interact with the system, 
      instead the provider is the one who interacts with the system for the member. 
      So the provider is the one that initiates the system after they provide services to the member. 
      For the use case diagram we broke it down in the most general sense we could and then expanded on each of those based on 
      if there were any more specifications for certain use cases. 
      We decided which situations we should include on the diagram and which ones should be in the descriptions. 
      We all brainstormed the use case diagram together on a white board to then determine the final diagram.  
      To write the descriptions, we split them up evenly among group members. 
      Each group member then read through the project description while writing the descriptions in order to provide as much detail as possible. 
      One group member wrote the html code for the Report.html file and their individual file RyanKutellaTeam11Report.html. 
      The other group members copied and pasted this outline for their own individual files and included their own use case diagrams. 
      After all of the tasks were finished, the submitter, Ali Burkemper, input all of the tasks into the Report.html outline to finish the report file.
